###### (this was a high school project)
By Colin, Milan and Jack

A chrome extension that tracks the amount of time you spend on chrome. Without clicking on the extention you are able to see the time in minutes and hours; The icon moves back and forth every second. After clicking on the extention you are able to see how long your current session has been running in hours:minutes:seconds and below that you can see your overall chrome use in days:hours:minutes:seconds format. The over all time tracker only shows the time that has passed sense the extention was downloaded. 

The purpose of this extension is to bring awareness to the amount of time we spend on the internet.
