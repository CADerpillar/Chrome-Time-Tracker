# Chrome-Time-Tracker
###### (this was a high school project)
By Colin, Milan and Jack

A Chrome extension that tracks the amount of time you spend on Chrome. Without clicking on the extension, you are able to see the time in minutes and hours. The icon moves back and forth every second. After clicking on the extension, you will see the length of both your current session and your overall Chrome use in hours:minutes:seconds. The overall time tracker will show the time that has passed since the extension was downloaded.

The purpose of this extension is to bring awareness to the amount of time we spend on the internet.
